-- Exercise 4
-- You are asked to implement a function that determines the degree outcome for a University of Southampton
-- undergraduate student who has successfully completed their studies. This could be First, UpperSecond,
-- LowerSecond, or Third, depending on their average, based on the regulations in section IV of the Calendar.
-- You can assume there have been either 3 or 4 years of study, and that each yearâ€™s marks are supplied by a list
-- of module results as in the previous exercise. This list will have one list of module results per year, so there
-- will be 3 entries for a three year degree, and 4 entries for a four year degree. For example classify
-- [[ModuleResult 60.0 45], [ModuleResult 60.0 45], [ModuleResult 20.0 45, ModuleResult 40.0 45]] = Third whereas
-- classify [[ModuleResult 60.0 45], [ModuleResult 20.0 55, ModuleResult 20.0 55, ModuleResult 20.0 55],
-- [ModuleResult 60.0 65], [ModuleResult 60.0 65]] = UpperSecond due to the different weightings of each year.
-- You may assume that each year has been successfully passed. Note that modules may have weights other
-- than 7.5 ECTS credit weightings and different years could, in principle, have different credit totals, each of
-- which is 60 ECTS credits or more and finally that the degree classification may depend on more than the
-- final average in certain situations. For simplicity, you are not expected to include ordinary degrees in your
-- solution.
