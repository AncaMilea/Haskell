-- Exercise 6
-- Use your solution to the previous exercise to find the nearest root to the given x of a polynomial f(x). Note
-- that f^2 is always zero or positive, so that any root of any function f is a minimum of f^2, and vice versa. The
-- nearestRoot function is supplied a list of coefficients defining the polynomial, so that nearestRoot [-18.0, 0.0,
-- 2.0] 0.0 5.0 1e-5 ~= 3.0 since the quadratic 2x^2 â€“ 18 has 3 as its only positive root. Note that the coefficients are
-- supplied in the reverse of the usual order, with the constant value at the head and the coefficient associated
-- with the highest power of x as the last value in the list. The second, third and fourth parameters to this
-- function are the same as those for the hillClimb function in the previous exercise.
